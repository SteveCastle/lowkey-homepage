      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        LowKey Media Viewer is a fast and simple image and video viewer for
        macOS and Windows that supports .jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, .mp4, and .webm
        file types. Designed for a visually rich experience that puts the images
        first with no distractions. Supports easy navigation with Mouse and
        Scrollwheel or Trackpad modes. View entire folders in folder view with
        options for recursive image discovery, sorting, and file type filters.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple Low Clutter UI</li>
        <li>No Wasted Space - Only your Images</li>
        <li>Folder Based Navigation and A Better List View Experience</li>
        <li>Lightweight Media Curation and Organization</li>
        <li>Transcript Based Video Navigation</li>
        <li>
          Support for the most common Animated and Video File Types (mp4, gif,
          webm, h265)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Basic Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        The main design principal of navigation in Lowkey Media Viewer is that
        you should spend most of your time and screen real estate on your images
        and videos.
      </p>
      <h3>Open a File/Directory</h3>
      <p>
        When you launch Lowkey Image Viewer you will be asked to select a file.
        Opening a file, automatically loads the other files in the directory
        into the list view. You can also associate media file types with LowKey
        Media Viewer and open files directly. You can change files at any time
        by using the file icon in the Command Palette.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/open-file.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Using Panels</h3>
      <p>
        There are four panels: List View(Left), Detail View(Middle),
        MetaData(Right), and Tagging(Bottom). To open a closed panel simply drag
        it open by clicking and dragging from the edge of screen. To close a
        panel drag the border between panels back to the edge.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/panels.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Using the Command Palette</h3>
      <p>
        Right click anywhere on the screen to bring up the command palette. This
        is the primary location of all controls and options in Lowkey Media
        Viewer.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/command.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Resizing List View Grid</h3>
      <p>
        To modify the size of the items in the list view grid use the grid tab
        in the command palette.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/grid-size.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Shuffle</h3>
      <p>
        To shuffle the images you can either click the shuffle icon in the
        command palette, or hit the X key. Use the sorting options in the
        command palette to return to a sorted view.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/shuffle.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h2>Curation</h2>
      <p>
        Lowkey Image Viewer includes an optional tagging panel that you can use
        to create collections of images and videos. Tags are saved to a local
        SQLite database in your home directory.
      </p>
      <h3>Creating a Category and Tag</h3>
      <video src="./help/create-tag.mp4" loop muted controls></video>

      <h3>Tagging an Image or Video</h3>
      <p>
        You can apply a tag by dragging it to either an image detail view, or an
        image in the list view.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/apply-tag.mp4" loop muted controls></video>

      <h3>Using an Image or Video as the Tag Preview Image</h3>
      <p>
        Hold down the <b>Shift</b> key before dragging a tag on to an image to
        use that image as the tag preview. You can also toggle on the Apply Tag
        Preview option in the Tagging panel side bar.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/tag-preview.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Tag all Images in the current list</h3>
      <p>
        Hold down the <b>Control</b> key before dragging a tag on to an image in
        the list view to apply the tag to every image currently in the list. Or
        select the "Tag All Images" toggle in the Tagging Panel Sidebar.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/bulk-tagging.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Reordering Tags and Media in a Collection</h3>
      <p>
        You can reorder tags and media in a collection by dragging them to a new
        location. You can only drag media if you are sorting by Weight.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/reorder.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Selecting Tags to View</h3>
      <p>
        You can view individual tags, or combinations of tags. When selecting a
        combination of tags you have the option of viewing all media that has at
        least one of the tags selected, or media that has all of the tags
        selected. To toggle this behavior use the Filtering Mode option located
        in the Tagging Panel Sidebar.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/filtering.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Searching Tag and File Names</h3>
      <p>
        Use the text inputs in the Tagging panel to search for files by file
        name in the active list view, or search for tags in your collection.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/search.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Edit and Delete Tags</h3>
      <p>
        Tag names can be edited and deleted. Editing a name will update all
        associated tag assignments. Deleting a tag will remove all tag
        assignments. Careful, this is currently not reverseable.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/edit-tags.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h2>Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        You can view common file metadata, and transcripts in the Metadata tab.
        Some types of metadata that are available include, Stable Diffusion
        WebUI PNG metadata, gallery-dl download metadata, and standard file size
        metadata.
      </p>
      <h3>Viewing Transcripts</h3>
      <p>
        Use the transcript tab within the Metadata panel to view any transcripts
        which are located in the same folder as the media file. Transcripts must
        have the same file name as the media, plus be the .vtt file format to be
        displayed.
      </p>
      <video src="./help/view-transcript.mp4" loop muted controls></video>
      <h3>Generating Transcripts</h3>
      <p>
        If you have the whisper command installed locally you can use it to
        generate transcripts.
