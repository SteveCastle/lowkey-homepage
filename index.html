        Double click anywhere on the screen to open Directory List View, double
        click on an image in list view to open that image.
      </p>

      <p>
        In list view you can also click hold and drag the images to reposition
        them inside the grid.
      </p>

        folder, and which image you are viewing. You can change directories, or
        change the file here. You can also toggle whether or not the list of
        images should recursively find files in nested folders.

      <h3>Hot Keys</h3>
      <p>
        You can configure the hotkeys on any action inside the Command Palette
        if you see a key icon on the right hand side of the action button. Click
        the button and you will be prompted to enter a new hotkey. If a hotkey
        already exists on another action it will be removed and replaced.
      </p>

        You can shuffle all of the current images in the folder, or if in
        recursive mode, in the folder and subfolders. By default the shuffle
        hotkey is X but you can change it in the Control settings tab.
