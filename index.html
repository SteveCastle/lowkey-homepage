      <h2 id="features">How to Use Lowkey Image Viewer</h2>
      <p>
        Lowkey Image Viewer is designed to be as simple as possible, but it does
        have some important features that will help you get the most out your
        experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Opening an Image or Video</h3>
      <p>
        You can open an image by using your native file browser. Just select a
        supported image type and open it using LowKey Image Viewer, which should
        be added to the list of available programs automatically.
      </p>
      <video src="./help_videos//open.mp4" loop autoplay muted controls></video>
      <h3>Window Controls</h3>
      <p>
        To close the program, or enter and exit fullscreen mode use the colored
        controls in the settings panel. Red to close, yellow to minimize,
        green to toggle fullscreen mode. By default Lowkey Image Viewer opens in fullscreen
        mode.
      </p>
      <video
        src="./help_videos//window-controls.mp4"
        loop
        autoplay
        muted
        controls
      ></video>
      <h3>Choosing a Control Mode</h3>
      <p>
        The control mode determines the method used to pan photos, and to flip
        through images in the directory.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Mouse and ScrollWheel Mode
      </h4>
      <p>
        You flip through photos using the scroll wheel, and you pan photos by
        clicking, holding, and dragging.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Trackpad Mode
      </h4>
      <p>
        You flip through photos by clicking to the right side of the image or on
        the left side to flip backwards, and you pan photos by scrolling with
        your trackpad or Magic Mouse.
      </p>
